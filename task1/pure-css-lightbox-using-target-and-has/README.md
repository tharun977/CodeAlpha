# Pure CSS Lightbox using :target and :has

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/designcouch/pen/abRNObK](https://codepen.io/designcouch/pen/abRNObK).

Now that we have a parent selector *SORT OF* available, I thought I'd try another no javascript lightbox - this time, with forward and reverse navigation.
